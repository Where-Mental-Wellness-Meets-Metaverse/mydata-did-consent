# DID-based Consent for Health Data

This repository provides a consent template aligned with MyData principles:
- Consent policy markdown (DID + Verifiable Credentials)
- Example Verifiable Credential (JSON-LD)
- Example OID4VP presentation definition

Goal: user-controlled, revocable, purpose-bound consent for health-data access.
